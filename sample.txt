Hi Tommy,

Thank you for asking for feedback!

You had a lot of energy, great ideas and a great assortment of skills, except in terms of experience we found that we had a better candidate. This time around with the recruitment we just happened to have a lot of strong candidates.
Donâ€™t let this deter you from applying next time!
For what to do next time - play around with skills related to content, any society and any subcom will appreciate basic image creation, the use of canva, being professional and humble.
We hope to see you around.

Kind regards
CSESoc Marketing Directors - Edwina and Eddy
